# James Cox's Profile Web Site
## Description:
I have developed this web site to showcase myself by way of a landing page that gives the user a navigation-bar, greeting and a short bio. Whereas, the navigation-bar has user options such as an about link that goes more in-depth into my background and a variety of my life's achievements. Also a portfolio link that displays my various coding projects compiled with a brief description and a link to view the code through the GitHub platform. Last, but not least, a blog link where every once in while I drop in and leave behind my thoughts for all to see and  possible creating a discussion board.
