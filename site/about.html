                    Well then welcome to my life and my story. I was born in Portland Oregon and was bumped up and down
                    and
                    all
                    around, traveling all over the west-coast in my younger years. I’m talking about Alaska to
                    California
                    with
                    stops in the states that lay in-between, but mostly my youthful years where spent in the wonderful
                    and
                    beautiful state of Oregon. Therefore, during the school year I was encased by the concrete jungle
                    and
                    living
                    among the hustle a bustle of the ever evolving city life. While my summers were spent in the foot
                    hills
                    with
                    my grandparents enjoying the rolling country side riding dirt-bikes on the family farm, fishing and
                    camping
                    or just splashing around in the local swimming hole.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    Thus, this is the time period were I found my love for art and what I now call the design process.
                    In
                    where unlocking what now everyone gets to be a witness too, since childhood. Although, it wasn't all
                    on
                    my own
                    I had the loving hands of an amazing family who were always there and able to give me those little
                    pushes
                    that life sometime require. You all know, the ones that get you over those little humps that you
                    just
                    cant
                    seem
                    to get over. Therefore, I am always in debt to them for keeping the inspiration alive in me and
                    allowing
                    me
                    to always be able to take that next step, no matter which way that step may take me.
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    Some of these steps have benefited me while others have hindered my abilities. Although, the
                    hindering
                    was
                    all my doing, but we’ll talk about that later. I first would like to focus on the achievements in my
                    life. I
                    have wore meany hats in my journey through life. All of them playing off of my strong strengths as
                    being
                    a
                    creative mind, starting with my first job in the family business. Here is where I was able to
                    acquirer
                    the
                    tools to be a successful artist, team player and the ability to manage that team, while also
                    learning
                    the
                    day to day operations compiled with the in’s and out’s of running a successful business.

                    Hence, with those soft and hard skills learned in my youth through the job ethics instilled by the
                    family

                    in
                    Central Oregon and prevailed in my abilities and obtained an Associates of Applied Science degree,

                    These accomplishments so far in life have allowed me to embark on an independent life style, and
                    have
                    giving me the ability to dominate not just the work force, but whatever life has thrown at me.
                    Therefore, while talking about stuff being thrown around and a person. I believe this to be the best
                    place to discuss some of the more harder time and diffidently not the best moments in my life. Some
                    people must travel through the valleys of hell to hopefully one day clawing your way to the mountain
                    tops. Although I feel mine where more like the creators of hell and those mountains, well they where
                    like crawling up an erupted volcano.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    My eruption started with a drug addiction in where it created a full on system failure in my life,
                    not
                    once, but twice in my existence. Let me tell you that you can never turn your back on an any
                    addictions
                    you may have in your life. Cause, believe you me it'll try to creep its way right back in when your
                    not
                    paying attention, boy howdy. These system crashes are not, let me repeat are not the high-light of
                    my
                    life. They lead to incarceration not once, but twice in this journey called life.

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    Although, these where total glitch in the matrix, I didn’t allow these glitches define person.
                    Instead I
                    took the time to dig in deep and reflect on ones self worth. Whereas, by doing so permitted the
                    necessary changes that were required in my life to be a productive individual in society. Where I’ve
                    gone on to be a loving father and husband, while also becoming a very successful tattoo business
                    owner.
                    Where at one point it seemed to be oddly enough that these cards would have never been dealt my way.

                    wasn't going to teach anymore, but seen in me the drive and determination, let alone the creative
                    mind
                    behind it all. So thank you for seeing in me what no one else did and taking that chance on that

                    That there was my first run at recovery and as I said before once an addict always an addict. I
                    differently forgot that part because I was tested and I failed miserably. So as you may have guessed
                    by now I was off to learn yet another lesson, because obviously I didn’t learn it the first time.
                    Yet once again I went on the internal search to find where everything went wrong. This time I was
                    determined to never let this happen to me again.
